That guide point toward the angle of the last note of the same color (if it's within X degree of the opposite cut direction), otherwise it will point in the opposite direction of the cut direction. The guide size scale with the note size. It is possible to modify the scale of the guide and the angle limiter within the in-game config menu or with the config file.
