# BeatSaber_NoteCutGuide
This plugin for Beat Saber add a guide to every note. That guide point toward the angle of the last note of the same color (if it's within 45 degree of the opposite cut direction), otherwise it will point in the opposite direction of the cut direction. Dot note are not supposed (yet). The guide size scale with the note size.
